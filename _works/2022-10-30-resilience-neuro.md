In late 2022, Kaylin, a devoted physical therapist specializing in neurological conditions and disabilities, reached out to develop a highly accessible, patient-centric website for her new independent clinic. Frustrated by the bureaucratic hurdles in the traditional healthcare system, she sought to focus on personalized, one-on-one patient care &mdash; in stark contrast to the "get 'em in, get 'em out" mindset of traditional hospital settings.

The website needed to ensure easy navigation, detail her specialized services, and integrate with her existing appointment scheduling software. It had to be mobile-friendly, SEO-optimized, and simple for Kaylin to update. Moreover, due to Kaylin's patient demographic, a core requirement was enhanced accessibility and ease-of-use.

Considering Kaylin's unique needs, I designed and developed a WordPress site that embodied her dedication to personalized, accessible care.

1. Accessible Design: The site featured an accessible, clean design, reflective of Kaylin's therapeutic approach. Responsiveness across all devices was ensured, alongside enhanced navigability for patients with various disabilities.
2. Clear Service and Pricing Pages: Comprehensive service pages detailed Kaylin's neurological-focused therapy. A Pricing area was added for her to be transparent about her care-related fees (something that had frustrated her about "Big Hospital" from the beginning).
3. SEO Optimization: The website was optimized for search engines, ensuring it could be easily found by those seeking her specialized services.

The project was completed in stages, incorporating Kaylin's feedback. I provided a tutorial on WordPress backend management, ensuring Kaylin could comfortably update her site.

By prioritizing accessibility and ease of use in the WordPress site design, Kaylin was better equipped to bypass traditional healthcare limitations and offer tailored, unhindered care to her patients with neurological conditions and disabilities. The results underpin the transformative power of a thoughtfully designed, accessible website in healthcare delivery.
