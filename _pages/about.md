I really enjoy making things, both physical and digital. When Iâ€™m not designing or coding, you can find me outside hunting, hiking, fixing things around the house, playing sports with my two kids, or getting beat by my wife at cribbage.

If you have a business, I can help you with website design, mobile app design, logo design, and brand identity design. I currently work full-time, so if you're comfortable with a designer who works off-hours, <a href="/contact/">drop your name, email, and a short message</a> and let's talk.
